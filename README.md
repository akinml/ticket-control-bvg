# ticket-control-bvg
This is a study project for a Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp.
Our workflow, in a nutshell consists of following steps: 
1. Scraping Telegram Data
2. Data Processing
3. Implementing ML technology to identify stations (Fuzzy matching using TheFuzz)
4. Data Analysis (see some graphs on our web page)
5. Implementing a supervised ML algorithm to predict the event of control (RandomForestClassifier - the model is okay: recall of almost 70%)
6. Integrating live updates (complex API built by Chris)

Our code can be messy at times, but we did our best. If you have comments or suggestions for improvement, do reach out.

p.s. With this project we do not promote any illegal activity. We support the idea of Zero-Fare Public Transport.
